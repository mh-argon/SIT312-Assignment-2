# SIT312-Assignment-2
This is the shared repository for assignment 2 of SIT312 System development and prototypes

It includes facedataset, facerecognize, facetrainer, argon.ino, and harrcascade_frontalface_default.
The purpose of project is to recognise the face in front of the camera.
facedataset will set camera settings, seta mount of images taken, and catagorise the individuals being taken images of.
facerecognize has most of the raspberry pi setup, it has the emailing and notofication featuere located in it, starts the video capture, and finally actually dictates whether someone is in fact accepted or not in regards to a break in.
facetrainer will ultimately store and "train" the images taken. This allows the system to compare faces so as to find any differences from a pool of samples.

This coding project was completed by Matthew Hall, David Kwok, Vansh Kwatra, and Ro-Wern Ong.
